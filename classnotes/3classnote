document object model = dom tree; left part of inspector
right part of inspecotr=css; order of most specific to least (declared = crossed out)

viewport = actual body area on the web page.

"Box Model"


Block level = 100% wide (automatically selected)
in CSS you can choose width, padding (padding-top/right..)
        (*padding is including the width of the element.)
border-size, color, type (example - border-bottom: 10px solid red;)
margin (does not include background color) 
        *can have sides of box declared (for padding, margin..) 
        example-> margin: 20px 100px 50px 60px; (clockwise from the top)
        *SHORT CUT-to declare 2 values instead of four
        example-> margin:20px 100px; (20px top and bottom, 100px left and right)
     typically declare either ALL 4 values or 2 values OR 1 value at a time..
auto margin = centers (divides space remmaining by 2) 
example-> margin:20px auto;  *auto margin works with left and right margin; 
wrapper (blank/general div that wraps around your page) 's common margin = 0px auto

how to make column layouts
1. "In-line block" 
automatic given decisions on web such as italicizing for <em> are called "inline"
display: inline-block; 
certain properties are not applicable for inline elements (does not push other away; if "display:block;" then it interpretates all)
</div> <div> ->no space; first space (enter) counts and not others.
- indents would not be legible...

So,
 
go to .wrapper (div) and put font-size:0
and then go to .column(div inside "div") and put font-size: 24px (any size you want)
So @ wrapper, there is no space between letters so they are horizontal
vertical-align: top; - > brings text to start at the same position.
height: 200px (text would run if longer.. if there was no height declaration then the page would be as high as the type would)
overlow:hidden; would chop off text that runs longer
*overflow: auto would have scrolling element.

overflow-y:auto;
overflow-x:hidden;
would be very common (INTERNAL SCROLL WITH ONLY ONE SCROLL not vertical and horizontal)
overflow:scroll; (even @ no running types there would be scroll)

"caniuse.com" search "hyphenation" shows what works where (working in green). 

2. Float Property
.column{
float:left;
}
Then they are all aligned (top) and side by side;
however the WRAPPER won't have height anymore.
*create div class=clear
*clear:both @ css and the clear div is invisible giving height (resume)
    clear:left (would work if float is left)
    if you do clear: right and float as left, the order of floating reverses.
JUST CLEAR BOTH

padding around column is the spacing between columns (width could be adjusted).

quick short notes
inline-block = give auto height depending on type; sits at baseline
float =align top and side to side

flexbox; another way of laying out pages.

hwk: continue to work on class home page sheet ; 
start on catalogue, in class syllabus-- think about what to catalogue;
can be anything ... doesn't have to be shown; representative..
different types of users..
